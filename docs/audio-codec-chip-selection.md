# Audio Codec Chip Selection for ESP32-Based Custom Phone with 4G Connectivity

## 1. Introduction: Overview of the Custom Phone Project and the Critical Role of the Audio Codec

The increasing demand for tailored IoT solutions has spurred interest in custom-designed communication devices. This report addresses the need for identifying suitable audio codec chips for a custom phone project that aims to integrate an ESP32 microcontroller with a 4G module (either SIM7670G or A7670) to enable voice communication. In such a system, the audio codec chip serves as the crucial link between the analog world of human speech and the digital processing capabilities of the microcontroller and the communication module. It is responsible for converting the analog audio signals from a microphone into a digital format that can be processed and transmitted, and for converting received digital audio data back into an analog signal that can drive a speaker.

The selection of an appropriate audio codec is paramount to the success of this custom phone project. Compatibility with both the ESP32, which commonly supports the I2S and PCM digital audio interfaces (Inter-IC Sound and Pulse Code Modulation, respectively), and the chosen 4G module is a fundamental requirement. Furthermore, the audio codec must meet stringent performance standards, primarily delivering good voice quality, characterized by high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and low Total Harmonic Distortion plus Noise (THD+N), to ensure clear and intelligible communication. Simultaneously, the codec should exhibit low power consumption to maximize the operational time of the battery-powered device. Finally, the availability of breakout boards or pre-built modules for the selected codec chips can significantly simplify the integration process, particularly during the initial prototyping and development stages. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of potential audio codec chips based on these critical factors, offering guidance for their selection and integration into the custom phone project.

## 2. Deconstructing the User's Requirements for the Audio Codec Chip

To effectively address the user's needs, it is essential to clearly delineate the specific requirements for the audio codec chip intended for this custom phone project:

- **Compatibility with ESP32 Microcontroller**: The audio codec must be capable of digitally interfacing with the ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 is known to support the I2S protocol, a standard for digital audio communication between ICs, as well as PCM, which is the fundamental digital audio encoding format often carried by I2S and other interfaces. Therefore, the codec should ideally support at least one, if not both, of these interfaces to ensure seamless communication with the ESP32.
- **Compatibility with SIM7670G or A7670 4G Module**: The chosen audio codec must also be compatible with the digital audio output of either the SIM7670G or the A7670 4G module. This necessitates understanding the specific digital audio format (I2S or PCM) and the physical interface through which these modules output audio data. The codec will need to be able to receive and process this digital audio stream to produce an analog signal for the speaker.
- **Support for I2S Interface**: The Inter-IC Sound (I2S) protocol is a widely used standard for transmitting digital audio between integrated circuits. Support for I2S on the audio codec would facilitate direct connection to the ESP32, which commonly features I2S peripherals for audio applications.
- **Support for PCM Interface**: Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) is the foundational method for digitally representing analog audio. While I2S is a protocol that often carries PCM data, the user's explicit mention of PCM suggests a consideration for codecs that might also handle raw PCM data or PCM in a format specific to telecommunications applications, as the project involves a phone.
- **Good Voice Quality**: For effective voice communication, the audio codec must be capable of capturing and reproducing speech with high fidelity. This is typically quantified by a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), which indicates the clarity of the desired voice signal relative to background noise, and a low Total Harmonic Distortion plus Noise (THD+N), which measures the level of unwanted distortion and noise introduced by the codec.
- **Low Power Consumption**: As the custom phone is envisioned as a portable, likely battery-powered device, the audio codec should exhibit low power consumption to help extend the operational time between charges and minimize heat generation within the device.
- **Availability of Breakout Boards or Modules**: To simplify the integration of the audio codec, especially during the initial stages of prototyping and development, the availability of breakout boards or pre-assembled modules is highly desirable. These boards typically provide easy access to the codec's pins and may include essential passive components, making it easier to interface with development platforms like the ESP32.

The user's requirement for both I2S and PCM support on the audio codec, even though I2S is a protocol for transmitting PCM data, indicates a potential need for versatility in interfacing with different components that might handle PCM audio in slightly different ways or through various physical connections. This suggests that the user is considering different levels of abstraction in the audio pathway and wants a codec that can accommodate various scenarios. Furthermore, the specific application as a "phone" implies that the voice communication will likely be optimized for speech frequencies, which are narrower than the full spectrum of high-fidelity audio. Therefore, while high-performance audio codecs exist, a codec specifically designed or well-suited for voice applications might offer a more efficient balance of audio quality, power consumption, and cost for this particular project.

## 4. A Primer on Audio Interface Standards: I2S and PCM in Embedded Systems

### I2S (Inter-IC Sound)

The Inter-IC Sound (I2S) protocol, also sometimes referred to as IIS, is a widely adopted synchronous serial interface standard specifically designed for the communication of digital audio data between integrated circuits. Developed by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors) in 1986, I2S simplifies the design of audio receivers by providing separate lines for clock and serial data signals, unlike asynchronous communication systems that require clock recovery from the data stream.

The I2S protocol utilizes three essential signal lines:

- **Serial Clock (SCK) or Bit Clock (BCLK)**: This line provides the timing reference for each bit of data being transmitted. The frequency of the bit clock is determined by the product of the audio sample rate, the number of bits per sample (bit depth), and the number of audio channels.
- **Word Select (WS) or Left/Right Clock (LRCLK) or Frame Sync (FS)**: This signal indicates which audio channel is currently being transmitted. For stereo audio, it typically toggles at the audio sample rate frequency, with one state (e.g., low) indicating the left channel and the other state (e.g., high) indicating the right channel.
- **Serial Data (SD or SDATA or SDIN or SDOUT or DACDAT or ADCDAT)**: This line carries the actual digital audio data, typically in the form of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) samples, transmitted serially, one bit at a time, synchronized by the bit clock.

An optional signal, the Master Clock (MCLK), is often included in I2S systems. The master clock provides a higher-frequency reference clock signal that is used internally by the audio converters (Analog-to-Digital Converters or ADCs and Digital-to-Analog Converters or DACs) within the audio codec chip to improve the accuracy and performance of the audio conversion process. The master clock frequency is typically a multiple of the word select frequency, commonly 256 times the LRCLK.

I2S is particularly well-suited for transmitting high-quality stereo audio due to its clear separation of signals and its ability to support various bit depths and sample rates. Consequently, it has become the de facto standard interface for connecting microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), and other digital audio devices to external audio codec chips in a wide range of embedded audio applications.

**Insight**: The synchronous nature of the I2S protocol, where the timing of data transfer is explicitly controlled by the clock signal, enhances the reliability and accuracy of digital audio communication. This inherent robustness against timing variations makes I2S a preferred choice for applications demanding high-fidelity audio. Furthermore, its ability to handle multiple channels efficiently makes it versatile for both simple voice communication and more complex audio scenarios.

### PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)

Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) is a foundational and widely utilized method for digitally representing analog signals, such as audio waveforms. This process involves sampling the continuously varying analog signal at discrete time intervals and then quantizing the amplitude of each sample into a digital value chosen from a predefined set of levels. The resulting sequence of digital values represents the original analog signal in a discrete, digital form.

PCM serves as the fundamental format for digital audio storage and transmission across a vast array of applications, including telephony systems, digital audio workstations, compact discs, and various streaming media platforms. The characteristics of PCM audio can vary significantly based on several parameters:

- **Bit Depth (Resolution)**: This refers to the number of bits used to represent the amplitude of each audio sample. A higher bit depth allows for a greater number of quantization levels, resulting in a wider dynamic range and a more accurate representation of the original analog signal. Common bit depths include 8-bit, 16-bit, and 24-bit.
- **Sampling Rate**: This parameter specifies the number of audio samples taken per second, typically measured in Hertz (Hz) or kilohertz (kHz). The sampling rate determines the highest audio frequency that can be accurately captured and reproduced. For instance, a sampling rate of 8 kHz is common in telephony, while 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz are standard for CD-quality audio and professional audio applications, respectively.
- **Number of Channels**: PCM audio can be monophonic (a single channel), stereophonic (two channels representing left and right audio), or multi-channel (more than two channels, as used in surround sound systems).
- **Data Ordering and Format**: The digital representation of PCM samples can be in various formats, including signed or unsigned integers, and the order in which the bytes of a multi-byte sample are transmitted (endianness) can also vary.

While I2S is a prevalent protocol for transmitting PCM-encoded audio data between integrated circuits, it is crucial to understand that PCM data itself can also be transferred through other digital interfaces or even processed directly in memory. In the context of the custom phone project, the 4G modules (SIM7670G and A7670) might handle the encoding and decoding of voice audio internally and then output the resulting digital voice data in a specific PCM format that may or may not strictly adhere to the I2S protocol's signaling conventions. This raw PCM stream would then need to be received and processed by the selected audio codec to produce the analog audio output for the phone's speaker. Therefore, when evaluating audio codec chips, it is essential to consider their ability to handle various PCM formats and their compatibility with the potential digital audio output characteristics of the chosen 4G module.

**Insight**: The user's deliberate mention of PCM alongside I2S indicates an awareness of the underlying digital audio format and the possibility that the 4G modules might output audio in a raw PCM stream, potentially via an interface that is not a standard I2S bus. This necessitates considering audio codecs that offer flexibility in handling different PCM formats and potentially supporting alternative digital audio interfaces beyond just the standard I2S three-wire connection.

## 6. Detailed Investigation of Audio Interface Support in the Specified 4G Modules

### SIM7670G 4G Module: Audio Interface Capabilities (I2S/PCM)

A thorough review of the available resources for the SIM7670G 4G module indicates that while it supports audio functionality for voice calls, the primary digital audio interface for connecting to an external codec appears to be PCM. The Arduino Pro 4G GNSS Module Global, which utilizes the Quectel EG25-G modem (part of the same product family as the SIM7670G from Quectel), explicitly lists "USB UART PCM/I2C" under its supported interfaces. This strongly suggests that the SIM7670G also offers a PCM interface for digital audio communication. Furthermore, the SIM7670G's capability to support dial-up, phone calls, and SMS implies that it handles voice audio internally and likely provides a way to output this processed digital audio, most probably in PCM format, for connection to an external audio codec to drive a speaker. While I2S is not explicitly mentioned as a primary digital audio interface in the overviews, further investigation of the SIM7670G's complete datasheet would be necessary to definitively confirm or deny its support for I2S.

| Interface Type | Number of Channels | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PCM            | Likely Mono        | Indicated by the presence of PCM interface on a related module (EG25-G) and the module's voice call functionality. |
| I2S            | Unknown            | Not explicitly mentioned in the overviews; requires confirmation from the full datasheet. |

### A7670 4G Module: Audio Interface Capabilities (I2S/PCM)

Research on the A7670 4G module reveals that it also features a digital audio interface likely to be PCM.

Crucially, snippet, referring to the A7670 Series Hardware Design, explicitly states that the module includes a "PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) interface which is a digital audio interface intended for connecting an external codec." This confirms the presence of a PCM digital audio interface on the A7670 module. Snippet also mentions "PCM Digital Audio Interface" for the A7670C variant. Similar to the SIM7670G, while I2S is not as prominently featured in the initial overviews of the A7670, the confirmed presence of a PCM digital interface indicates a pathway for connecting to an external audio codec to handle voice output. The A7670's support for dial-up, phone, and SMS functionalities further supports its capabilities for voice communication.

| Interface Type | Number of Channels | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PCM            | Likely Mono        | Explicitly identified as a digital audio interface for connecting an external codec according to the hardware design documentation. |
| I2S            | Unknown            | Not explicitly mentioned in the overviews; requires confirmation from the full datasheet. |

## 7. Comprehensive Compatibility Assessment: Identifying Audio Codecs Suitable for ESP32 and the Selected 4G Modules

Based on the analysis of the ESP32's audio interface capabilities (I2S and PCM) and the likely primary support for PCM on both the SIM7670G and A7670 4G modules, the following audio codec chips appear to be suitable candidates for the custom phone project:

### Codecs with Strong PCM Support

- **CMX655D**: While not explicitly using the term "PCM interface" in the same way as I2S, this codec is designed for digital voice applications and supports telephony bandwidths, suggesting a primary mode of operation compatible with PCM audio streams. Its flexible serial audio interface likely allows for configuration to handle PCM data from the 4G modules. The ESP32 would need to interface with its serial audio interface, which might require careful configuration but is feasible.

### Codecs with I2S Support (Potentially Compatible with ESP32 and 4G Modules)

- **ES8388**: This codec is known for its I2S support and compatibility with ESP32. If the SIM7670G or A7670 modules also support I2S output for audio to an external codec (which requires confirmation from their full datasheets), then the ES8388 would be a very suitable option.
- **SGTL5000**: Similar to the ES8388, the SGTL5000 supports I2S and is compatible with ESP32. Its suitability depends on the 4G modules also offering an I2S interface for external audio codec connection.
- **WM8960**: With confirmed I2S support and compatibility with ESP32, the WM8960's applicability hinges on the 4G modules also supporting I2S audio output to an external codec.

## 8. Critical Considerations: Voice Quality and Low Power Consumption in Audio Codec Selection

| Codec          | ADC SNR (dB) | DAC SNR (dB) | Power Consumption (Typical) | Key Features for Voice                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ES8388         | 95           | 96           | 16 mW                       | Stereo, integrated microphone and headphone amps                                       |
| SGTL5000       | 85-93        | 98-100       | < 9.3 mW - 16 mW            | Ultra-low power, comprehensive analog I/O                                              |
| WM8960         | 94           | 98           | 20 mW                       | Stereo, integrated speaker and headphone amps, ALC                                     |
| TLV320AIC3263  | 93           | 101          | 6.1 mW (rec), 2.7 mW (play) | Stereo, miniDSP for advanced processing, multiple digital audio interfaces             |
| CMX655D        | Not stated   | Not stated   | Ultra-low power             | Mono voice codec, supports telephony and HD voice bandwidths                           |

The table above provides a comparative overview of the shortlisted audio codec chips, focusing on their voice quality (represented by ADC and DAC Signal-to-Noise Ratio), typical power consumption during operation, and key features relevant to voice communication. Higher SNR values generally indicate better audio clarity with less background noise. Lower power consumption is crucial for maximizing the battery life of the custom phone.

It is evident that there is a trade-off between voice quality and power consumption. Codecs like the TLV320AIC3263 offer excellent audio performance with high SNR values but might consume slightly more power than ultra-low-power options like the SGTL5000 or CMX655D. The CMX655D, being specifically designed for voice, emphasizes ultra-low power and support for telephony-grade audio, which might be sufficient for basic phone communication while offering significant power savings. The ES8388 and WM8960 provide a good balance of stereo capabilities, integrated amplifiers, and reasonable power consumption, making them versatile options if the 4G modules support I2S or a compatible PCM format.

For a voice-centric application like a phone, the CMX655D's optimization for speech bandwidth and its ultra-low power nature make it a particularly interesting candidate. While its audio performance metrics (SNR, THD+N) are not explicitly stated in the overview, its focus on telephony and HD voice suggests that it is designed to provide adequate voice quality for communication while being highly efficient in terms of power usage. This aligns well with the primary needs of a phone device where clear voice transmission and reception, along with extended battery life, are paramount.
