# Phone Zero Project Milestones - Accelerated MVP Approach

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a highly compressed development schedule focused on rapidly creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of the Phone Zero device. The accelerated approach prioritizes core functionality over refinement, with the goal of producing a functional prototype that demonstrates the key value proposition: an accessible bedside phone for elderly blind users.

The project is condensed into three major phases: Planning & Component Selection, MVP Development, and MVP Validation. This aggressive timeline reduces the original 40-week timeline to just 10 weeks by focusing exclusively on essential features, using off-the-shelf components where possible, and simplifying the physical design.
