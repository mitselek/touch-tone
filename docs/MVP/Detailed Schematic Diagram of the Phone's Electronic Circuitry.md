# Detailed Schematic Diagram of the Phone's Electronic Circuitry

## Overview

The schematic diagram serves as the definitive blueprint for the phone's electronic architecture, translating finalized specifications into a tangible product design. It details all interconnections and electrical characteristics of components throughout the system.

## Core Components

The schematic must include the following essential components:

- Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32)
- 4G module
- Speaker
- Movement sensor
- Vibration module
- Battery
- Power management system
- USB-C port
- Mains power connection

## Electrical Specifications

### Component Interconnections

- All electrical connections between components must be meticulously illustrated
- Specify pin assignments, signal pathways, and control lines
- Clearly indicate voltage levels and current ratings for each component

### Voltage Management

- Implement a well-defined power distribution network to accommodate varying voltage requirements
- Include bidirectional logic level converters where needed (e.g., between 1.8V UART interface on 4G modules and 3.3V logic on ESP32)
- Clearly depict the placement and configuration of voltage converters

## Power Management System

### Power Source Integration

- Detail how power is sourced from both the USB-C port and battery
- Include voltage regulators and DC-DC converters for stable power supply
- Ensure each component receives appropriate voltage within its specified operating range

### Regulation Requirements

- ESP32 typically operates at 3.3V, requiring regulated input from USB or battery
- 4G module voltage requirements must be accommodated by the power management circuitry
- Implement power selection mechanism to manage transitions between mains power and battery

## Testing and Safety Considerations

### Debugging Infrastructure

- Incorporate clearly labeled test points for each component and critical signal
- Document expected voltage levels and signal types at test points
- Position test points for convenient access during troubleshooting

### Safety Mechanisms

- Implement fail-safe mechanisms throughout the design
- Include protection circuits against:
  - Over-voltage conditions
  - Over-current scenarios
  - Reverse polarity (particularly at power input and battery connections)
