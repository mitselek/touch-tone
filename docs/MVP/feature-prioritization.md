# Phone Zero MVP Feature Prioritization

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the prioritization framework for the Phone Zero MVP, categorizing features into "must-have" essentials required for the initial functional prototype versus "future release" enhancements. The prioritization focuses on delivering core functionality that validates the central value proposition of an accessible bedside phone for elderly blind users while deferring non-essential capabilities to subsequent iterations.

By clearly delineating feature priorities, this framework helps maintain focus on the MVP's critical path, enabling faster development cycles and providing a structured approach to evaluating potential feature additions. The prioritization is aligned with the project's accelerated timeline and emphasis on validating core functionality through minimal, essential features.

| Speaker & Microphone | Must-Have | Fundamental for voice communication |
| USB-C Power Connection | Must-Have | Required for device power and charging |
| Small Battery Backup | Must-Have | Minimal backup for demonstration purposes |
| Simple Protective Enclosure | Must-Have | Basic physical protection for components |

#### Call Functionality

| Feature | Priority | Justification |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Make calls to pre-programmed numbers | Must-Have | Essential core functionality |
| Receive incoming calls | Must-Have | Essential core functionality |
| Answer calls via button press | Must-Have | Critical accessibility feature |
| End active calls | Must-Have | Essential control function |
| Basic audio quality for voice calls | Must-Have | Minimum viable call quality |

#### User Feedback

## Decision Framework for Feature Evaluation

When evaluating whether a proposed feature belongs in the MVP or should be scheduled for a future release, use the following criteria:

1. **Core Functionality Impact**: Does the feature directly enable or improve the basic ability to make and receive calls?

2. **Accessibility Requirement**: Is the feature essential for making the device usable by elderly blind users?

3. **Technical Dependency**: Is this feature required for other must-have features to function?

4. **Development Timeline Impact**: Can the feature be implemented within the accelerated MVP timeline?

5. **Validation Value**: Does this feature help validate the core concept and value proposition?

If a feature receives "Yes" answers to at least three of these questions, particularly questions 1, 2, and 5, it should be considered for inclusion in the MVP. Otherwise, it should be prioritized for future releases.

## Feature Request Evaluation Template

For new feature requests that arise during development, use this simple evaluation template:

```text
Feature Name: [Name]
Description: [Brief description]
Requested by: [Source]

MVP Criteria Assessment:
- Core Functionality Impact: [Yes/No] - [Explanation]
- Accessibility Requirement: [Yes/No] - [Explanation]
- Technical Dependency: [Yes/No] - [Explanation]
- Timeline Impact: [Yes/No] - [Explanation]
- Validation Value: [Yes/No] - [Explanation]

Decision: [MVP / Future Release]
Prioritization (if Future): [Near-term / Mid-term / Long-term]
```

This structured approach ensures consistent evaluation of feature requests against established MVP criteria.
